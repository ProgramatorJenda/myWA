No order just brainstorming

1. Add a table that tracks buffs that has been disabled since last update of frames
2. Clean up removed frames
3. Create Edit mode that shows all loaded frames with low alpha
4. Add buttons to Edit mode that enables the movement of frames
    - on close or save -> disable movement and save positions
5. Add Glow texture on frames when active
6. Create new Windows for the addon, edit mode
7. Add settings for frames alpha and size
