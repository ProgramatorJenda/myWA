This is MY take at the WoW WeakAuras Addon.
I have little knowledge of Addon making, only made a single addon that tracks all available PET WQs around the zones

Always wanted to try and make my stuff in Wow.. but never knew how.
I have a few goals that I wanna learn and make for this project

1. Figure out a way to chose and show Auras to track
    -  Track debuffs later on
2. Create a UI with a menu that updates the tracked Auras
    - Get players current class and show buffs menu based on that
    - Different menu for debuffs from all classes (good for PVP)
3. Make textures movable around the screen and save its position, so it doesnt reset on each reload
4. Make this usable for multiple if not all classes
5. Actually finish this
